\
The SNOMED CT URI standard defines a standard format of URIs for identifying various SNOMED CT artefacts including components and RF2-based releases. This includes standard URIs for formally identifying the SNOMED CT international edition, national editions, and any specific _versions_ thereof. It does not cover URIs for non-SNOMED CT code systems. Nor does it cover RF1-specific artefacts.

This document provides guidance on using the SNOMED CT URI standard in the context of key motivating use cases, including resolvability of the URIs.
