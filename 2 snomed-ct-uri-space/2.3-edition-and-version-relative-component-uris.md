# 2.3 Edition and Version-Relative Component URIs

# Background

Edition and version-relative URIs are useful to identify characteristics of components and reference set members that are specific to an edition or version. Conceptually, they build on the idea of what one resource (e.g. the version) says about another (e.g. a component).

# Form

Edition-relative URIs for components take the following form:

<http://snomed.info/sct/{moduleid}/id/{sctid}>

Version-relative URIs for components take the following form:

<http://snomed.info/sct/{moduleid}/version/{time}/id/{sctid}>

Edition-relative URIs for reference set members take the following form:

<http://snomed.info/sct/{moduleid}/id/{uuid}>

Version-relative URIs for reference set members take the following form:

<http://snomed.info/sct/{moduleid}/version/{time}/id/{uuid}>
