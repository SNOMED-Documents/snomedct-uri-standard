# 2.2 URIs for Components and Reference Set Members

# Background

A SNOMED CT component is a concept, description or relationship that conforms with the SNOMED CT logical model. All SNOMED CT components are identified by an SCTID. [1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCURI/2.2+URIs+for+Components+and+Reference+Set+Members#Footnote1 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") .

A SNOMED CT reference set member is a uniquely identified row of a reference set. All reference set members are identified by a UUID (rather than an SCTID). 

# Form

URIs for components, based on the corresponding SCTID, take the following form:

http://snomed.info/id/{sctid}

URIs for members of a Reference Set, based on the corresponding UUID, take the following form: 

http://snomed.info/id/{uuid}

For simplicity this document refers to either of the above forms as a _component URI_. 

# Examples

The following table shows some examples of URIs for components and reference set members.
