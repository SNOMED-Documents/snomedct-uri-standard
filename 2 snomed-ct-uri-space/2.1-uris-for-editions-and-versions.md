# 2.1 URIs for Editions and Versions

# Background

A SNOMED CT edition logically consists of the complete set of members of one or more modules.[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCURI/2.1+URIs+for+Editions+and+Versions#Footnote1 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") Since the [module dependency reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPRELFMT/5.2.4.2+Module+Dependency+Reference+Set) (MDRS) tracks the explicit dependencies between a version of a module and all the versioned modules it depends on, a module identifier[2](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCURI/2.1+URIs+for+Editions+and+Versions#Footnote2 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") is a natural identifier for an edition. When combined with a timestamp corresponding to a sourceEffectiveTime appearing in the MDRS, the module identifier can unambiguously identify a version of an edition.

# Form

The URIs that identify unversioned editions (i.e. editions) and versioned editions (i.e. versions) take the following respective forms:

http://snomed.info/sct/{sctid}

http://snomed.info/sct/{sctid}/version/{timestamp}

Note, while it would be possible to extend this pattern to support multiple root modules, each with their own sourceEffectiveTime, this would introduce non-trivial complexities. For example, the modules they each depend upon may themselves overlap but have different versions (targetEffectiveTime) in which case the implied content would be inconsistent.

# Examples

The following table shows some examples of URIs for editions and versions.
