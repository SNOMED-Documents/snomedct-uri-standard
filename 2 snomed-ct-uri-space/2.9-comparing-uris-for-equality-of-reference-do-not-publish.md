# 2.9 Comparing URIs for Equality of Reference - DO NOT PUBLISH

Any two URIs from the <http://snomed.info/> URI space identify the same thing if, after syntax-based normalisation as described in section 6.2.2 of IETF RFC3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCURI/2.9+Comparing+URIs+for+Equality+of+Reference+-+DO+NOT+PUBLISH#Footnote1 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") , they are equal when treated as character strings. The syntax-based normalisation includes case normalization, percent-encoding normalization, and removal of dot-segments. Scheme-based and protocol-based normalisation should not be required since any URIs that would be affected by them (e.g. by including explicit port numbers or trailing slashes) fall outside of the URI space defined by the standard.

Note that computable language strings identified using the [http://snomed.info/{syntaxCode}](http://snomed.info/syntaxCode) URI spaces represent literal strings of a specific language and version (if specified). Therefore:

  * URIs that identify different literal expressions are  _not_ equivalent, even if those expressions are semantically equivalent. For example:
    * <http://snomed.info/scg/125605004>, [http://snomed.info/scg/125605004|Fracture of bone|](http://snomed.info/scg/125605004Fractureofbone) and [http://snomed.info/scg/76069003:{363698007=272673000,116676008=72704001}](http://snomed.info/scg/76069003:363698007=272673000,116676008=72704001%7D) are  _not_ equivalent
  * URIs that represent the same precoordinated code in different languages are  _not_ equivalent. For example:
    * <http://snomed.info/id/125605004>, <http://snomed.info/scg/125605004> and <http://snomed.info/ecl/125605004> are  _not_ equivalent
  * URIs that represent the same literal expression in different syntax versions are  _not_ equivalent (unless the syntax versions are considered to be equivalent)[2](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCURI/2.9+Comparing+URIs+for+Equality+of+Reference+-+DO+NOT+PUBLISH#Footnote2 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") . For example:

    * [http://snomed.info/scg/version/2.1/76069003:{363698007:272673000}](http://snomed.info/scg/version/2.1/76069003:363698007:272673000%7D) and [http://snomed.info/scg/version/2.4/76069003:{363698007:272673000}](http://snomed.info/scg/version/2.4/76069003:%7B363698007:272673000%7D) are  _not_ equivalent.

For example "1" is equivalent to "1.0" and "1.0.0"; and "2.3" is equivalent to "2.3.0"
