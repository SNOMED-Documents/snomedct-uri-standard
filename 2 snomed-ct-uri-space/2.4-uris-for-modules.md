# URI Standard : 2.4 URIs for Modules

# Background

[Section 2.1](2.1-URIs-for-Editions-and-Versions_29951164.html) defined URIs for editions and versioned editions. These URIs identify the contents of a Module plus all of the Modules it depends on (based on the module version dependencies). However, it is sometimes necessary to simply identify the contents of a single specified module only. 

# Form

URIs for modules come in two forms. To identify the contents of a module, independent of any particular point in time, the following form is used: 

http://snomed.info/module/{sctid}

To identify the contents of a module at a particular point in time, the following form is used:

http://snomed.info/module/{sctid}/time/{timestamp}

Note that the timestamp used above is merely referencing a point in time, and does not need to coincide with a version release date. 

# Examples

The following table shows some examples of URIs for modules.
